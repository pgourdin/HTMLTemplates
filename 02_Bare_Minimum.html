  Template Note:

      This template is the bare minimum for a well-formed HTML
      document. It does not include any CSS or Javascript links.
      As such, it should be used only for simple, static HTML
      documents that use all default styles and behavior.

  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      global attributes - the set of attributes in the HTML
      specification that can be applied to any element. The
      most commonly used global attributes related to the
      semantics of elements include: class, id, dir, lang
      (and xml:lang). Most of the others are related to
      interactive aspects of the content. Of special note,
      though, is that the style attribute should no longer
      be used (relying on external CSS style sheets alone).

  Numbered Inline Comments:

  (1)

      In a well-formed HTML5 document, the root element must
      be the <html> element. It's first child can only be the
      <head> element. It's second child can only be the <body>
      element.

  (2)

      The "lang" attribute is a global attribute. There is a
      convention to indicate the primary language of the document
      by setting the lang attribute of the root "html" element;
      thus, it is considered part of the bare minimum template.
      If the lang attribute is not present on the html tag the
      browser (or web crawler) will do a best effort attempt at
      divining the base language with the existing text content.

  (3)

      This is the first example of an element attribute. Although
      not strictly required, it is good practice to surround all
      attribute values with double quotes. Attributes are
      separated by spaces within the element header. For empty
      elements, the closing "/>" must be separated by a space
      from the last attribute. For example,
      
        <tag attr="value" attr="value" />

  (4)

      The <head> element can contain: meta data, using the <meta>
      element; embedded javascript, using the <script> element;
      embedded CSS style information, using the <style> element;
      <link> elements, which are used exclusively, in modern usage,
      to link external (CSS) style sheets to the current document;
      the mandatory <title> element; and, the <base> element, which
      is used to indicate the base URL for all relative URL references
      in the document.

      In general, it is considered best practices to segregate all
      style code in external .css files, that are referenced through
      <link> elements, and all javascript in external .js files, that
      are referenced through empty <script> elements (using the "src"
      attribute).

  (5)

      The <meta charset ...> element specifies the character encoding
      for the document. The value "UTF-8" specifies that the document
      is encoded in a common Unicode encoding. Even though "UTF-8" is
      the default for HTML5, it is still considered good form to specify
      it explicitly. (The default before HTML5 used to be "ISO-8859-1".)

  (6)

      The <meta charset ...> element must be within the first 1024
      bytes in the HTML file. To ensure this, always have this element
      be the first child under <head>. (Note, that as of 1/2016 the W3
      org validator will give an error message if it is not within the
      first 512 characters, an older standard.)

  (7)

      The <body> element is the parent element for all presentable
      content of the HTML document. As we saw in the absurd minimum,
      the <body> element is not strictly required explicitly; it will
      be generated implicitly if absent. However, it makes more sense
      to make it explicit.
