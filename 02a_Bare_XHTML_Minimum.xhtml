  Template Note:

      This template is the bare minimum for a well-formed XHTML5
      document. It does not include any CSS or Javascript links.
      As such, it should be used only for simple, static XHTML
      documents that use all default styles and behavior.

  Numbered Inline Comments:

  (1)

      XHTML5 is an XML document markup language. The "xmlns" attribute
      specifies the standard XHTML namespace. Note also that for XHTML5
      the DOCTYPE keyword must be all upper case.

  (2)

      The "xml:lang" attribute is a global attribute. In XHTML5
      documents this should be used rather than "lang", in order
      for the proper XML parsing of the document.

  (3)

      All XHTML5 documents must be well-formed XML documents, which
      means: 1) all empty elements (such as the <meta> element here)
      must be properly closed with a trailing " />" (note the space
      between the attribute value end-quote and the closing tag);
      2) all non-empty elements must have a closing tag; 3) all
      attribute values must be properly enclosed in double quotes;
      4) not all named entities are supported (e.g., "&copy;" is not).
      Generally, it's a good idea to follow the stricter requirements
      of XHTML5 in all HTML documents (with the exception of #4, above).
