          <h3>Template Note</h3>
          <p>This template represents a basic
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">
            HTML</abbr> document with basic web content.
            It focuses on showing the semantic structure
            of a typical HTML document containing
            primarily static text content. Other
            templates in this series will introduce
            more diverse elements.</p>

          <h3>Some Concepts and Terminology:</h3>
          <p>Tim Berners-Lee designed and created
            the first version of the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/History.html">
            world wide web (aka "the web")
            from 1989 through 1990</a>. The design
            was a simple server/client model based on HTML,
            <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">
            URL</abbr>s, and
            <abbr title="Hyptertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP
            </abbr>.
            
            These concepts and designs were not new. HTTP was built on top
            of the existing internet network protocols. URLs was built
            on top of the <abbr tabindex="Domain Name System">
            DNS</abbr> internet protocol. HTML was based on <abbr
            title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML
            </abbr> and the existing concept of hypertext linked
            documents. In addition, he created the first browser
            to edit and present linked HTML documents. The
            simple design of the web allowed for rapid adoption
            and dynamic growth of the HTML design from an original
            ten elements to over one hundred and twenty elements
            (of which twelve are now depricated).
HTML is the specification for a text based markup language
      for structured documents. It's original intent was to
      specify a technology for the presentation of a set of
      inter-related documents connected through hypertext links.
      The CSS and Javascript specifications were later added to
      refine and enhance the presentational, dynamic, and
      interactive capabilities of these connected, structured
      documents.          </p>

<!--
          
      <p>Historically, the first HTML specifications leaned
      heavily to describing syntax and presentation. Later
      specifications, especially the first inclusion of CSS,
      started to lean toward more syntactical and semantic
      information. With the advent of HTML5 the expectation
      became that HTML would describe the syntax and
      semantics of a document, leaving presentation and
        dynamic bevahior to CSS and Javascript respectively.</p>
      <p>
      This transition is not quite complete: there are still
      remnants of presentation and behavior in HTML5 (e.g.,
      see the behavior described in the <abbr> element, below).
      It is not hard to find the presentational roots when
      you scratch the surface of most HTML documentation.
      However, the current intent of the HTML specification
      is that HTML markup provides the syntactical and
      semantical description of a web 'document', and that
      the presentational/behavioral aspects are primarily
        contained in CSS and Javascript files.</p>

- the history of the web is a classic example of the law of the conservation of difficulty: simple solutions only solve simple problems
- web technology started with a simple solution built on established ideas and existing technology in use (i.e., unix, distributed computing, internet, markup languages, document management systems, graphical displays)
- web technology has grown organically
- enabled by it's simple start and that CERN released the early technology to royalty free public access
- organic growth enabled by multiple, simultaneous, independent development of browser technology
- explosive growth of the web
- standardization has predominantly followed a 'mop up' model rather than a 'lead the parade' model, resulting in a lot of cleaning up shit
- problems that were not solved at the beginning of the web design have haunted web technology ever since: version management, link maintenance (e.g., link rot), compatability/conformance issues, bloats due to workarounds/shivs/resets, security issues, accessability


      Again ... syntax is the tree structure ... we talk
      about parents, children, siblings, etc. ... syntax
      requires semantics to understand the structure

      Block level vs inline level elements - Prior to HTML5
        there was a general categorization of elements into
        either block level or inline level. Intuitively, block
        elements are paragraphs and inline elements are words
        or phrases in paragraphs. More generally, block elements
        are arranged vertically (with a linebreak before a
        block) and inline elements are arranged (by default) in
        a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order within the parent
        block.

        This strict notion is obsolete, primarily because it is
        a presentational concept, rather than a semantic concept.
        The Content Model (below), in HTML5, replaced the idea
        of block-level vs inline-level in HTML. The concept does
        survive in the CSS display property, where it properly
        lives.

      Content Model - something
      </p>

      global attributes - are the set of attributes in the HTML
      specification that can be applied to any element. The
      most commonly used global attributes related to the
      semantics of elements include: class, id, dir, lang
      (and xml:lang). Most of the others are related to
      interactive aspects of the content. Of special note,
      though, is that the style attribute should no longer
      be used (relying on external CSS style sheets alone).</section>

  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      

  Numbered Inline Comments:

  (1, 2)

      The <span> and <div> elements represent the prototypical
      and generic elements for phrasing content and (block level)
      flow content. Because they are generic, they carry no real
      semantic meaning, other than that provided (indirectly)
      through the "id" and "class" attributes, see (2) below.
      As such, they should be used only when no other element
      provides the appropriate, intended semantics.

  (2)

      The "id" and "class" attributes are both global attributes
      and serve very similar purposes. They both add meta-data to
      elements that allows for general ("class") and/or specific
      ("id") classification of elements that is document or web
      site specific. They come closest to allowing a way to 'name'
      and find elements, for purposes of specifying presentational
      (CSS) and/or dynamic (Javascript) aspects. The difference
      between the two is that the value for an "id" attribute can
      only be applied to exactly one element, whereas a given
      "class" attribute value can be applied to any given number
      of elements. A given element can have both "id" and "class"
      attributes.

      Prior to HTML5 these were the primary ways to provide
      semantics for common div and span element classes, such
      as headers and footers. There was an effort in the HTML5
      specification to identify the most common semantic
      structures and make them more standard by specifying
      explicit elements to carry these semantic designations.
      This includes such new elements as <header>, <footer>,
      <article>, <section>, <nav>, <figure>, etc. The <mark>
      element was the only new <span> level semantic element
      added.

      The best practice for "id" and "class" values is that
      they convey semantic meaning, rather than presentational
      or behavior connotations. In addition, don't use spaces
      in the values.

  (3)

      The <h1> element is one of a set of heading content
      elements that carry the semantics of text headers for
      the parts of a web page that represent 'sections' of
      content. They have such specific semantics that they
      have their own content model category. They are ranked
      elements, from <h1> through <h6>.

      The general idea is that the lower the number the 'higher'
      in hierarchical ranking in the documents structure. For
      example, an <h1> element might represent the title heading
      for the document. An <h2> element then might represent a
      major section of the document, with a descendant <h3>
      element of that section representing a sub-header.

  (4)

      The <p> element semantically represents a paragraph of text.
      Historically, text has been the primary content data of HTML
      documents, and <p> elements represent the most common block
      level text element. Best practice dictates that a recognizable
      body of text that is a paragraph should be contained in a <p>
      element.
