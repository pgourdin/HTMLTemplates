<!doctype html>

<!--  HTML5 is a document markup language. The root element of all
      HTML documents is the "html" element.

      The "lang" attribute is a 'global attribute' (which means that
      it can be applied to any element, and not just the <html> element).
      There is a convention to indicate the primary language of the
      document by setting the lang attribute of the root "html" element.
      Thus, it is considered part of the bare minimum template. -->

<html lang="en">

  <!--    The html element has two canonical child elements: <head>
          and <body>. The <head> element contains all of the HTML
          document's meta information, as well as embedded CSS and
          javascript. The <body> contains the displayable content.

          The <head> element can contain: meta data, using the <meta>
          element; embedded javascript, using the <script> element;
          embedded CSS style information, using the <style> element;
          <link> elements, which are used exclusively, in modern usage,
          to link external style sheets to the current document; the
          mandatory <title> element; and, the <base> element, which is
          used to indicate the base URL for all relative URL references
          in the document.

          In general, it is considered best practices to segregate all
          style code in external .css files, that are referenced through
          <link> elements, and all javascript in external .js files, that
          are referenced through empty <script> elements. -->

  <head>

    <!--  The <meta charset ...> element specifies the character encoding
          for the document. The value "UTF-8" specifies that the document
          is encoded in a common Unicode encoding. Even though "UTF-8" is
          the default for HTML5, it is still considered good form to specify
          it explicitly. (The default before HTML5 used to be "ISO-8859-1".) -->
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>2 Bare Minimum</title>
  </head>

  <!--  The <body> element is a mandatory element of a well-formed HTML
        document and represents the parent element for all displayable
        content of the HTML document. As we saw in the absurd minimum,
        the <body> element is not strictly required explicitly; it will
        be generated implicitly if absent. As such, it makes more sense
        to make it explicit. -->

  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Bare Minimum HTML5 Template</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The barest of templates, with no external CSS style or javascript files. This does not support browser specific workarounds (such as accomodations for IE). This does not reset the default styles.</p>

    <!-- SAMPLE ELEMENTS 

         The sample elements below are not always explicitly documented here, because
         they are primarily content based, versus structural. -->

    <hr>
    <article>
      <h2>&lt;h2&gt; Example Elements</h2>
      <p>The following represent samples of most (but not all) HTML5 elements. This is meant to showcase formatting of standard elements as well as progress through the HTML/CSS templates. Other than this paragraph, and element descriptions, sample text is from Machiavelli's The Prince, and is not meant to be descriptive, but, merely, to appear as realistic text.</p>
      <h3>&lt;h3&gt; Inline Elements (Phrasing Content)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> named anchor, <a id="namedAnchor">such as this</a></li>
          <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> hypertext link to external URI, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">such as this</a></li>
          <li><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> Some browsers, when hovering over an abbreviation, such as <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, will display the text of the <code>title</code> attribute.</li>

          <!-- The <bdi> and <bdo> elements are used to indicate that the contained
               text may (bdi) or will (bdo) contain bidirectional text that differs
               from the surrounding text. This is a structural/content designation,
               although, based on the direction attribute, does contain formatting
               information (i.e., directional flow).

               The difference between <bdi> and <bdo> is one of intent. The <bdi>
               element allows for different bidirectional text, but is often used
               for cases where the the HTML code is generated automatically and the
               actual text content can be different languages. In other words, the
               text may or may not have different directionality. -->
          
          <li><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> This "מוֹעִיל" is the hebrew word for "helpful". For the sake of demonstrating what problem bdo and bdi elements are trying to solve, consider the sample HTML text "<code>what is flexible is helpful - 1</code>". The problem is the browser's understanding that the "- 1" should 'follow' the word "helpful". The bdo element is required to have the dir attribute. So, here are each of the different ways that bdo and bdi are used:

After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons.</p>

    <h3>&lt;h3&gt; Table Related Elements</h3>
      <p>The table related elements include all elements used to build tables in HTML5. It is no longer acceptable style to use table elements for formatting purposes. The elements given as examples here include: &lt;caption&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;tfoot&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tr&gt;. There's no good reason to use &lt;col&gt; and &lt;colgroup&gt;, since the same affect can be achieved through the use of classes.</p>

      <!-- The <table> element has one attribute, the summary attribute,
           that can be useful. It is used for accessibility to describe
           the table (duplicate of the caption element content?). -->

      <table summary="This is the table summary">
        
        <!-- The <caption> element, if present, must be the first child of the table
             element. -->
        
        <caption>
          This is the table caption
        </caption>
        
        <!-- It makes aesthetic sense that the order of the of the <table> children
             should be <thead> then <tbody> then <tfoot>. Note that before HTML5 the
             <tfoot> element had to come after the <thead> element. -->

                   element: the former is not meant to properly hold data content for
                   the table, but, instead, descriptive (or definitional) data about
                   the contents of the table--more structural than content. But, it
                   should not be used for style purposes, even though the default
                   styles do style <th> different from <td>. The styling should still
                   be done using classes and css style sheets. -->

      <p>The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.</p>
      <p>But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.</p>
      <p>When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.</p>
