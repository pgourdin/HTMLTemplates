  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      Historically, the first HTML specifications leaned
      heavily to describing syntax and presentation. Later
      specifications, especially the first inclusion of CSS,
      started to lean toward more syntactical and semantic
      information. With the advent of HTML5 the expectation
      became that HTML would describe the syntax and
      semantics of a document, leaving presentation and
      dynamic bevahior to CSS and Javascript respectively.

      This transition is not quite complete: there are still
      remnants of presentation and behavior in HTML5 (e.g.,
      see the behavior described in the <abbr> element, below).
      It is not hard to find the presentational roots when
      you scratch the surface of most HTML documentation.
      However, the current intent of the HTML specification
      is that HTML markup provides the syntactical and
      semantical description of a web 'document', and that
      the presentational/behavioral aspects are primarily
      contained in CSS and Javascript files.

      Again ... syntax is the tree structure ... we talk
      about parents, children, siblings, etc. ... syntax
      requires semantics to understand the structure

      Block level vs inline level elements - Prior to HTML5
        there was a general categorization of elements into
        either block level or inline level. Intuitively, block
        elements are paragraphs and inline elements are words
        or phrases in paragraphs. More generally, block elements
        are arranged vertically (with a linebreak before a
        block) and inline elements are arranged (by default) in
        a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order within the parent
        block.

        This strict notion is obsolete, primarily because it is
        a presentational concept, rather than a semantic concept.
        The Content Model (below), in HTML5, replaced the idea
        of block-level vs inline-level in HTML. The concept does
        survive in the CSS display property, where it properly
        lives.

      Content Model - something

  Numbered Inline Comments:

  (1, 2)

      The <span> and <div> elements represent the prototypical
      and generic elements for phrasing content and (block level)
      flow content. Because they are generic, they carry no real
      semantic meaning, other than that provided (indirectly)
      through the "id" and "class" attributes, see (2) below.
      As such, they should be used only when no other element
      provides the appropriate, intended semantics.

  (2)

      The "id" and "class" attributes are both global attributes
      and serve very similar purposes. They both add meta-data to
      elements that allows for general ("class") and/or specific
      ("id") classification of elements that is document or web
      site specific. They come closest to allowing a way to 'name'
      and find elements, for purposes of specifying presentational
      (CSS) and/or dynamic (Javascript) aspects. The difference
      between the two is that the value for an "id" attribute can
      only be applied to exactly one element, whereas a given
      "class" attribute value can be applied to any given number
      of elements. A given element can have both "id" and "class"
      attributes.

      Prior to HTML5 these were the primary ways to provide
      semantics for common div and span element classes, such
      as headers and footers. There was an effort in the HTML5
      specification to identify the most common semantic
      structures and make them more standard by specifying
      explicit elements to carry these semantic designations.
      This includes such new elements as <header>, <footer>,
      <article>, <section>, <nav>, <figure>, etc. The <mark>
      element was the only new <span> level semantic element
      added.

      The best practice for "id" and "class" values is that
      they convey semantic meaning, rather than presentational
      or behavior connotations. In addition, don't use spaces
      in the values.

  (3)

      The <h1> element is one of a set of heading content
      elements that carry the semantics of text headers for
      the parts of a web page that represent 'sections' of
      content. They have such specific semantics that they
      have their own content model category. They are ranked
      elements, from <h1> through <h6>.

      The general idea is that the lower the number the 'higher'
      in hierarchical ranking in the documents structure. For
      example, an <h1> element might represent the title heading
      for the document. An <h2> element then might represent a
      major section of the document, with a descendant <h3>
      element of that section representing a sub-header.

  (4)

      The <p> element semantically represents a paragraph of text.
      Historically, text has been the primary content data of HTML
      documents, and <p> elements represent the most common block
      level text element. Best practice dictates that a recognizable
      body of text that is a paragraph should be contained in a <p>
      element.
