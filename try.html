      <h2>Template Note</h2>
      <p>This template is the bare minimum
         for a well-formed HTML document. It
         does not include any CSS or Javascript
         links. As such, it should be used only for simple, static HTML
        documents that use all default styles and behavior.</p>

  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      global attributes - are the set of attributes in the HTML
      specification that can be applied to any element. The
      most commonly used global attributes related to the
      semantics of elements include: class, id, dir, lang
      (and xml:lang). Most of the others are related to
      interactive aspects of the content. Of special note,
      though, is that the style attribute should no longer
      be used (relying on external CSS style sheets alone).    </article>
