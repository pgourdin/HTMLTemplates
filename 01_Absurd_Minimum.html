  Template Note:

      Those two lines are it. This represents the absurd minimum
      necessary for an HTML5 document that will validate without
      errors. It represents an empty HTML document, as far as
      body content. This is not a useful template, but one that
      acts as a starting point for exploring the current HTML
      living standard.

      Note that the 'html', 'head', and 'body' elements  are
      automatically generated for the document's DOM (see
      terminology below).

  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      HTML is the specification for a text based markup language
      for structured documents. It's original intent was to
      specify a technology for the presentation of a set of
      inter-related documents connected through hypertext links.
      The CSS and Javascript specifications were later added to
      refine and enhance the presentational, dynamic, and
      interactive capabilities of these connected, structured
      documents.

      HTML has evolved to specify (primarily) the logical and
      semantic structure of the text, graphic, image, video and
      audio content, although it stills retains some historical
      presentational aspects. CSS has evolved to specify the
      presentational aspect of the content. Javascript has evolved
      to specify the dynamic and interactive aspect of the content.

      An HTML document consists of a doctype declarator
      followed by a set of HTML elements. The basic logocial
      structure of a document is a tree with a root element,
      named "html". The root html element always has exactly
      two children elements: the "head" element and the "body"
      element.

      HTML elements follow one of two basic textual patterns:
        <element-tag attributes>content</element-tag>
      or
        <element-tag attributes />

      The latter elements are called 'empty elements' and do not
      have any explicit content. The former can have content
      that consists of text and/or other elements. Note that
      there are some elements (e.g., <br>, <img>, etc.) that
      can only be empty elements.

      Attributes are key=value pairs. Attributes provide a way
      to further describe an element and its content. Some
      attributes provide ways to further define the element's
      content itself (such as defining the URI for an image
      element). Other attributes are used to provide meta-data
      about the element. Such meta-data can be used to refine
      semantic information about the element and/or provide
      information that can be used for presentational purposes
      (i.e., CSS) or dynamic purposes (i.e., Javascript).

      In general, there is meant to be a strict separation of
      purpose for head elements versus body elements. All content
      that is in elements contained in the head sub-tree represent
      document related meta-data (including CSS and Javascript
      data). All content that is in elements contained in the
      body sub-tree represent presented data.

      For purposes of describing HTML documents and HTML elements,
      along with the respective CSS and Javascript support, this
      set of HTML document template instances, of which this is the
      first, contain comments about the associated elements in each
      document. For each element, typically as it first appears in
      the set of documents, the corresponding comment describes the
      element and its syntactical, structural, semantic, dynamic,
      and presentational aspects. Actual text content can also
      provide commentary, as appropriate. (Any text content that
      does not provide commentary will be sample text from
      Machiavelli's "The Prince".) Most presentational aspects will
      be documented in the comments in the corresponding CSS files.
      Most dynamic aspects will be described in the corresponding
      Javascript files.

      These templates, and the corresponding comments, represent
      a (generally) accepted approach to best practices for coding
      web sites and web applications. These are not meant to be an
      exhaustive examination of very nook and cranny of modern Web
      technology, or even what is and is not acceptable practice.
      But, it is also meant to be browsed by both beginners and
      experienced Web programmers.

      To that end, it is important to understand some key concepts
      and terminology, presented henceforth, throughout all templates
      as necessary:

      Document Object Model (DOM) - used by CSS to apply presentation
      styles to target classes of elements and unique instances of
      elements. It is used by Javascript to allow the programmatic
      perusal and dynamic manipulation of the document data. It makes
      concrete the tree-hierarchy structural model of the HTML document.

      Quirks Mode - Browsers will go into 'quirks mode' in displaying
      an HTML document when they encounter 'malformed' HTML or HTML
      code that predates HTML W3C standards. The quirks mode represents
      non-standard presentation and interaction, often that that predates
      IE 6.

  Numbered Inline Comments:

  (1)

      The doctype indicates that this is an HTML document
      file. The HTML5 standard did away with all of the
      extraneous DTD information present in doctype declarations
      in past versions (including html and xhtml document types),
      opting for a simple, clean approach. The doctype is not an
      element, although it looks like one. It is best to think
      of it as the first--and necessary--text line of the HTML
      file.

      Note: IE does not tolerate a comment before the doctype. It
      will go into quirks mode if there is anything before the
      doctype.

  (2)

      This represents the first instance of a comment, and acts
      as an obvious example of how HTML comments are formatted.

  (3)

      There is only one mandatory 'head' element: the <title>
      element. The element's content is the text of the title.
      The only content permitted is text. The title is displayed
      in the browser toolbar and is used as the text for the page
      as added to browser 'favorites' and search engine results.
      It is the only meta-data that is presented in some way for
      the document.
