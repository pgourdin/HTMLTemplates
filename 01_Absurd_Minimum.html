<!doctype html>

<!--  The doctype indicates that this is an HTML document
      file. The HTML5 standard did away with all of the
      extraneous DTD information present in doctype declarations
      in past versions (including html and xhtml document types),
      opting for a simple, clean approach.

      Note: IE does not tolerate a comment before the doctype. It
      will go into quirks mode if there is anything before the
      doctype. This is the only time that a comment will follow the
      element that it documents. -->

<!--  Some Concepts and Terminology:

      HTML is the specification for a text based markup language
      for structured documents. It's original intent was to
      specify a technology for the presentation of a set of
      inter-related documents connected through hypertext links.
      The CSS and Javascript specifications were later added to
      refine and enhance the presentational, dynamic, and
      interactive capabilities of these connected, structured
      documents.

      HTML has evolved to specify (primarily) the logical and
      semantic structure of the text, graphic, image, video and
      audio content, although it stills retains some historical
      presentational aspects. CSS has evolved to specify the
      presentational aspect of the content. Javascript has evolved
      to specify the dynamic and interactive aspect of the content.

      An HTML document consists of a doctype declarator
      followed by a set of HTML elements. The basic logocial
      structure of a document is a tree with a root element,
      named "html". The root html element always has exactly
      two children elements: the "head" element and the "body"
      element.

      HTML elements follow one of two basic textual patterns:
        <element-tag attributes>content</element-tag>
      or
        <element-tag attributes />

      The latter elements are called 'empty elements' and do not
      have any explicit content. The former can have content
      that consists of text and/or other elements. Note that
      there are some elements (e.g., <br>, <img>, etc.) that
      can only be empty elements.

      In general, there is meant to be a strict separation of
      purpose for head elements versus body elements. All content
      that is in elements contained in the head sub-tree represent
      'meta' data about the document (including CSS data and
      Javascript data). All content that is in elements contained
      in the body sub-tree represent presented data.

      For purposes of describing HTML documents and HTML elements,
      along with the respective CSS and Javascript support, this
      set of HTML document instances, of which this is the first,
      contain comments before the associated elements describing
      the element and the syntactical, structural, semantic,
      dynamic, and presentational aspects of that element and its
      particular exemplary instance. Actual text content can also
      provide commentary, as appropriate. Any text content that
      does not provide commentary will be sample text from
      Machiavelli's "The Prince".

      To that end, it is important to understand some key concepts
      and terminology at the start:

      Document Object Model (DOM) - used primarily by Javascript
      to allow the programmatic perusal and dynamic manipulation
      of the document data. It is used by CSS to apply styles to
      individual and 'classes' of elements. It makes concrete the
      tree-hierarchy structural model of the HTML document.

      global attributes - the set of attributes in the HTML
      specification that can be applied to any element.

      Content Flow Model - 
      -->

<!--  There is only one mandatory 'head' element: the <title>
      element. This is the title that is displayed in the browser
      toolbar and is used as the text for the page as added to
      'favorites' and search engine results. It is the only
      'meta' data that is presented in someway for the document. -->

<title>1 Absurd Minimum</title>

<!--  That is it. This represents the absurd minimum necessary for
      an HTML5 document that will validate without errors. It
      represents an empty HTML document, as far as body content.
      Note that the 'html', 'head', and 'body' elements are
      automatically generated for the document's DOM. This is
      not a useful template. -->
